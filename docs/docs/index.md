# LypidDyn

Automated computational pipeline, implemented in Python3,for the accurate 
analysis of the structural properties and dynamics of lipid bilayers simulations.
LipidDyn has been developed to include parameters that can be used to validate simulation 
ensembles against experimental data.
The included analysis are able to take into account embedded proteins into the membrane.
